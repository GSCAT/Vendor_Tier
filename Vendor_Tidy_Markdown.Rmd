# Setting up the Environment

We start by loading the proper Libraries.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(xtable)

```

Next, define a path to the target directory. Don't worry about the file name, we will use `dirname()` to trim to the filename from the directory when necessary. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
path <- file.path('~', 'Executive Dashboard', 'Q2 2016', 'Vendor', 'my_file.csv')
dirname(path)
```

This gives us a path string to to the above directory.

# Importing the Data

Next we read the file to a data table with the following code. 

```{r  tidy=TRUE}
Parent_Vendor_Table <- read_csv(paste(dirname(path), 
                                      'Parent Child Vendors with Tier 20160730.csv', 
                                      sep = '/'))
```

# The Raw Data
In order to reduce work and minimize error, it is important to present __GIS__ with a clean and concise table for which to manage the _Vendor_ _Tiering_ Status. This is best accomplihsed with a concise table in which each vendor has one row; and the tiering status is contained in a single column per catagory. This table\-\-though concise and porper for human readability\-\-is not conducive to joining in a database environment. Have a look at a sample of the raw table:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

a_table <- Parent_Vendor_Table %>% 
  sample_n(10, replace=TRUE) %>% 
  select(-(1:4))

knitr::kable(a_table, format="markdown")

# # png("test.png")
# par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
# plot(cars)
# plot(cars)
# plot(cars)
# plot(cars)
# 
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# plot(mtcars)
# plot(mtcars)


# ![]("test.png")




```

Not all columns are shown above, but you can see that there are separate columns for _Wovens_, _Knits_, etc. they cleanest way to store these data in a database would (for joining) would be to convert these multiple column values into a single column with a type. That is where `tidyr` comes in!

# Tydying the Data

We can gather the Category columns, into a value and key pair, very easily with the `tidyr` package. Using `tidyr::gather()` we can _gather_ the multiple columns into a a value and key column using the code below.

```{r}
Parent_vendor_Master <- Parent_Vendor_Table %>% 
  select(-(1:4)) %>% 
  gather("Category", "Tier", 
         Wovens, Sweaters, Knits, IP, 
         `Denim & Woven Bottoms`, `Category Other`, 
         Accessories, `3P & Lic`)

Parent_vendor_Master %>% slice(c(1:7, 11:13)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Notice there are now two columns labeled _Category_ and _Tier_. The Category columns have been gathered into a value and key pair. This is a much better form in which to store our data. However, there are NA's in this table that we do not need. So let's remove them! We do this by adding `na.rm = True` to our previous code.  

```{r}
Parent_vendor_Master2 <- Parent_Vendor_Table %>% 
  select(-(1:4)) %>% 
  gather("Category", "Tier", 
         Wovens, Sweaters, Knits, IP, `Denim & Woven Bottoms`, 
         `Category Other`, Accessories, `3P & Lic`, na.rm=TRUE)

Parent_vendor_Master2 %>% slice(c(1:7, 11:13))%>%
knitr::kable()
```

Let's just make sure we do not have any non-distinct rows. 

```{r}
Parent_vendor_Master2 <- Parent_Vendor_Table %>% 
  select(-(1:4)) %>% 
  gather("Category", "Tier", Wovens, Sweaters, Knits, IP, `Denim & Woven Bottoms`, 
         `Category Other`, Accessories, `3P & Lic`, na.rm=TRUE) %>% distinct()

Parent_vendor_Master2 %>% slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


How cool is that!
